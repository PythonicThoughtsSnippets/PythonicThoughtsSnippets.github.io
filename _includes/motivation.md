# Motivation

I created the **Pythonic Thoughts Snippets** _series_ out of the need to share my connection with the code I write, how my vision and style evolve, how my mindset for code writing shapes with time in a continuous quest towards writing more maintainable, easy to read, robust and beautiful code.

This series is not about _HowTo's_ or _Tutorials_, but about discussions that facilitate a continuous learning based on the acquisition of cleaner and improved coding practices, understanding and patterns. I actually do not bother much on explaining again what other thousand of places on the _wild_ web do explain very well. Here, comments and discussions flow as they come, as I live them.

When needed, along side with the posts, I also add the corresponding _pseudo_-code snippets. Code snippets are also available for download separately in the [Code Snippets Repository](https://github.com/PythonicThoughtsSnippets/PTS-Code-Snippets).

I hope you find these little articles of interest. I will definitively appreciate if you share your comments as this is a process of continuous learning; you can do so by [raising an issue](https://github.com/PythonicThoughtsSnippets/PTS-Code-Snippets/issues).  

These posts are the result of many online and book readings, discussions with others and hours spent staring at the code. Please consider I am not a purely computational person, I am a biochemist passionate about coding that have learned my way through this beautiful discipline -- well... now actually I am a full-time programmer :-o.

Posts follow no structured order, they are added sequentially as I write; newest posts come first in the list bellow - yeah, just like a blog ;-). Expect posts to mutate with time, as my vision changes as well I may come back and edit them; **edit** tags will be added on edited discussions.  

Enjoy,

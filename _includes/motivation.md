# Motivation

I created the **Pythonic Thoughts Snippets** _series_ because I need to share my connection with the code I write and read, how my vision and style evolve with time, in a continuous quest towards writing more maintainable, easy to read, robust and beautiful code.

This blog is **not** about _Tutorials_ or recipes on _HowTo_ do things with Python, there are thousands of websites out there that address such topics beautifully. This blog is about about highly contextualised discussions regarding implementations, designs, strategies, patterns, and alike. Accordingly, I do not provide extensive introductions to the topics I discuss, I just expect the reader to be as knowledge as me *(whatever that is)* and directly engage the discussion. If you feel a topic is too advanced and you can't follow, I hope you bookmark the page and come back in a future time; if you are much more experienced than me and notice my argument is wrong or not accurate I hope you bookmark the page as well. Whatever is the case, please [raise and issue](https://github.com/PythonicThoughtsSnippets/PTS-Code-Snippets/issues) and let's discuss!

When needed, alongside with the posts, I also add the corresponding _pseudo_-code snippets. Code snippets are also available for download separately in the [Code Snippets Repository](https://github.com/PythonicThoughtsSnippets/PTS-Code-Snippets).

Posts in this blog are the result of many online and book readings, discussions with others, and hours spent staring at the code. Please notice my background is not on Computational Sciences, I am a biochemist passionate about coding that have learned my way through this beautiful discipline -- *well... now, I am actually a full-time programmer in Python. :-o*

Generally, posts follow no structured order, they are added sequentially as I write; newest posts come first in the list bellow -- yep, just like a blog ;-) -- but, sometimes, post series naturally emerge. Expect posts to mutate with time, as I become wiser *(or mad)* I may come back and edit them; **edit** tags will be added on edited discussions.  

Enjoy,
